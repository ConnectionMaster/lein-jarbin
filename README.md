# lein-jarbin

A lein plugin to run binaries contained a jar.

This can be used for e.g. complicated system startup procedures, or daemonizing. Think of it as similar to lein-init-script, but without the installation process, or lein-daemon but less opinionated (and more reliable!).


## Usage

Put `[lein-jarbin "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

    $ lein jarbin [foo/bar "1.2.3"] bbq.sh
    $ lein jarbin ./foo-bar-1.2.3.jar bbq.sh
    $ lein jarbin . bbq.sh

Will run the script in resources/bin/bbq.sh, in the jar, or the local project source tree.

In the first usage, jarbin will download the jar if necessary. The jar should be resolvable from standard jar locations, or add a repo to your ~/.lein/profiles.clj

The second usage takes a path to a local jar on the filesystem. The third usage is for running from the source tree.

Extra args can be included on the command line:

    $ lein jarbin [foo/bar "1.2.3"] bbq foo 2 3

Environment variables can be specified in the project.clj:

    :jarbin {:bin-dir "bin" ;; relative to resources. optional, defaults to "bin",
             :scripts {"bbq.sh" {:env {:foo "bar"
                                       :name :lein/name
                                       :version :lein/version
                                       :JVM_OPTS :lein/jvm-opts}}}

Environment variables with the 'lein' namespace, like :lein/name will take their values from the same key in the project.clj

## Limitations
Jarbin creates a temp directory, containing your project.clj and the script. Due to races, and jarbin not knowing when you're 'done' with the code, it never cleans up the temp directory.
